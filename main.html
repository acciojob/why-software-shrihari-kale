	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	 <p>
    I want to become a developer because I love solving problems and creating things that make a difference. Coding allows me to combine logic and creativity — I can turn ideas into working solutions. It’s a field that keeps evolving, so I’ll always keep learning and improving myself. I also enjoy the satisfaction of building something useful that helps people and makes life easier through technology.
